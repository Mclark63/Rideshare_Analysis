# Uber Vs. Lyft Boston, MA Analysis 

Within the past 10 years, Uber and Lyft have become the two most used rideshare apps in the country. The big question when trying to decide how to catch a 
ride or even who to work for is which app should I use? Lyft or Uber? Of course, consumers are looking for which app will cost less money while drivers 
are concerned about which app will make them more money. Each person has their own goal based on their status when opening the apps, but no matter if 
youâ€™re a driver or a customer saving and making money is a primary goal. 

### Objective 

This project will analyze Uber and Lyft data in Boston, Massachusetts by assessing where and when customers and drivers benefit the most. By comparing each company's data, consumers will be able to choose which app to use based on where and when prices are the lowest. On the other hand, drivers will have the opportunity to see where and when they will make the most money while using either app. Weather, location, time and distance are all factors that will be considered when analyzing the data. The overall goal is to determine which rideshare app is more beneficial to customers and their contracted drivers.
